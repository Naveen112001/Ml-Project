Six young health participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions:
* exactly according to the specification (Class A)
* throwing the elbows to the front (Class B)

Assignment:
The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. 
This is the “classe” variable in the training set. In the next sections We will show how a model was buily,
what variables we selected and why in order to build our model and run the predictions. 
We will also cover the topics of cross validation, what is our estimate of the expected out of sample error. 
Finally, our prediction model will be used to predict 20 different test cases.
